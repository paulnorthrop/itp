Description: Implements the Interpolate, Truncate, Project (ITP) root-finding 
    algorithm developed by Oliveira and Takahashi (2021) <doi:10.1145/3423597>.
    The user provides a the function, from the real numbers to the real 
    numbers, and an interval with the property that the values of the function
    at its endpoints have different signs. If the function is continuous over 
    this interval then the ITP method estimates the value at which the function
    is equal to zero. If the function is discontinuous then a point of 
    discontinuity at which the function changes sign may be found. Tuning 
    parameters of the ITP algorithm can be set by the user. Sensible default
    values are set based on arguments in Oliveira and Takahashi (2021).
