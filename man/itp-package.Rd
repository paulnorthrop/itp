\title{itp: The Interpolate, Truncate, Project (ITP) Root-Finding Algorithm}
\description{
Implements the Interpolate, Truncate, Project (ITP) root-finding
algorithm developed by Oliveira and Takahashi (2021).
The user provides a function, from the real numbers to the real numbers, and
an interval with the property that the values of the function at its
endpoints have different signs. If the function is continuous over this
interval then the ITP method estimates the value at which the function is
equal to zero. If the function is discontinuous then a point of
discontinuity at which the function changes sign may be found. The function
can be supplied using either an R function or an external pointer to a C++
function. Tuning parameters of the ITP algorithm can be set by the user.
Default values are set based on arguments in Oliveira and Takahashi (2021).
